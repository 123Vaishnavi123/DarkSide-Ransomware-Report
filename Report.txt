Introduction:
DarkSide ransomware is a relatively new ransomware strain that threat actors have been using to target multiple large, high-revenue organizations resulting in the 
encryption and theft of sensitive data and threats to make it publicly available if the ransom demand is not paid.

DarkSide ransomware, first seen in August 2020 and updated as v2.0 in March 2021, is associated with the DarkSide group and now often operates as ransomware-as-a-service 
(RaaS). The DarkSide ransomware group has a history of double extortion of its victims. It asks for payment to unlock the affected computers and also to retrieve the 
exfiltrated data.

Techniques that the attackers have used in DarkSide ransomware can be very sophisticated: Initial access by Exploiting Public-Facing Applications (e.g. RDP), Privilege 
Escalation, and Impair Defenses.

DarkSide ransomware makes use of vulnerabilities CVE-2019-5544 and CVE-2020-3992. Both vulnerabilities have widely available patches, but attackers are targeting to 
organizations using unpatched or older versions of the software. During encryption DarkSide ransomware uses a customized ransom note and file extension for their victims.

Attack Patten of DarkSide Ransomware:
1.Initial Access:DarkSide ransomware performs brute force attacks and exploits known vulnerabilities in the remote desktop protocol (RDP) to gain initial access. After
initial access DarkSide ransomware does validation on the machines to infect. DarkSide ransomware collects the information about computer name and system language 
in its initial code execution. DarkSide is used to target English-speaking countries. DarkSide ransomware also checks the default system language.

2.Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement: Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that are used to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. 
Privilege escalation attacks can be performed if a malicious user exploits a bug or configuration error in an application or operating system. Privilege escalation is 
used to gain elevated access to resources that should not normally be available to the user. DarkSide ransomware checks for if the user has administrator privileges; 
if not, it will try to get administrator privileges by using UAC bypass technique making use of CMSTPLUA COM interface.

3. Data Exfiltration: DarkSide ransomware identified data backup applications, exfiltrates data, and then encrypts local files as part of the ransomware deployment.

4. Delete Volume Shadow Copies: Ransomware campaigns often attempt to delete the volume shadow copies of the files on a given computer so that their victims will not 
be able to restore file access by reverting to the shadow copies. DarkSide ransomware deletes the volume shadow copies via PowerShell scripts.

5. Impair Defenses: DarkSide disables security protection services using the Impair Defenses technique to avoid possible detection of their tools and activities. This 
can take the form of killing security software or event logging processes, deleting Registry keys so that tools do not start at run time, or other methods to interfere
with security tools scanning or reporting information. DarkSide ransomware deletes the services.

6. Ransomware Execution: Ransomware generates the custom file extension based on machine GUID and using API RtlComputeCRC32. File extension generated by using Machine 
GUID is of 8 characters and will be added to each encrypted file name.To prevent ransomware detection, DarkSide uses encrypted APIs, strings and ransom notes. DarkSide
ransomware excludes some of the files based on the file extension. Files are encrypted using Salsa20 and a key randomly generated using RtlRandomEx API and encrypted 
using an RSA-1024 public key.

7. Vulnerabilities Exploited: As reported by Zdnet, Ransomware attackers can attack virtual infrastructure through weak versions of the VMware ESXi hypervisor. 
DarkSide ransomware attackers have used CVE-2019-5544 and CVE-2020-3992 vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi. Both vulnerabilities are patched, but attackers are still 
targeting organizations using unpatched or older versions of the software. Open SLP (Service Layer Protocol) is used for multiple virtual machines to store 
information on a single server in VMware ESXi hypervisor.

Known Attack vectors:
1.CVE-2019-5544:
A malicious actor with network access to port 427 on an ESXi host or on any Horizon DaaS management appliance may be able to overwrite the heap of the OpenSLP 
service resulting in remote code execution.

2. CVE-2020-3992:
A malicious actor residing in the management network who has access to port 427 on an ESXi machine may be able to trigger a use-after-free in the OpenSLP 
service resulting in remote code execution.

DarkSide Targets:
DarkSide is believed to be based in Eastern Europe, likely Russia, but unlike other hacking groups responsible for high-profile cyberattacks it is not believed to be 
directly state-sponsored (i.e., operated by Russian intelligence services). DarkSide avoids targets in certain geographic locations by checking their system language 
settings. In addition to the languages of the 12 current, former, or founding CIS countries the exclusion list contains Syrian Arabic. Experts state that the group 
is "one of the many for-profit ransomware groups that have proliferated and thrived in Russia" with at least the implicit sanction of the Russian authorities, who 
allow the activity to occur so long as it attacks foreign targets.[8] The language check feature can be disabled when an instance of ransomware is built. One such 
version was observed in May 2021. Additionally, DarkSide does not target healthcare centers, schools, and non-profit organizations.

Ransomware code used by DarkSide resembles ransomware software used by REvil, a different hacking group; REvil's code is not publicly available, suggesting that 
DarkSide is an offshoot of REvil[12] or a partner of REvil.[4] DarkSide and REvil use similarly structured ransom notes and the same code to check that the victim is 
not located in a Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country.

According to Trend Micro Research data, the United States is by far DarkSide's most targeted country, at more than 500 detections, followed by France, Belgium, and
Canada.[13] Of 25 countries observed by McAfee the most affected by DarkSide attacks in terms of number of devices impacted per million devices are Israel (1573.28), 
Malaysia (130.99), Belgium (106.93), Chile (103.97), Italy (95.91), Turkey (66.82), Austria (61.19), Ukraine (56.09), Peru (26.94), the U.S. (24.67).

As of June 2021, DarkSide has only published data from one company; the amount of data published exceeds 200 GB.


DarkSide Ransomware attacks:
1. 2020(August to October):
The group was first noticed in August 2020. Cybersecurity company Kaspersky described the group as an "enterprise" due to its professional-looking website and attempts
to partner with journalists and decryption companies. The group "has publicly stated that they prefer to target organizations that can afford to pay large ransoms 
instead of hospitals, schools, non-profits, and governments." The group has sought to foster a "Robin Hood" image, claiming that they donated some of their ransom 
proceeds to charity. In a darkweb post, the group posted receipts for donations of BTC 0.88 (then worth US$10,000) each to Children International and to The Water 
Project dated to October 13, 2020; Children International stated that it will not keep the money.

2. 2020 to 2021(December to May):
From December 2020 to May 2021, ransoms demanded by the group ranged from US$200,000 to US$2 million. DarkSide attacked U.S. oil and gas infrastructure on four 
occasions. DarkSide ransomware hit the IT managed services provider CompuCom in March 2021, costing over US$20 million in restoration expenses; it also attacked 
Canadian Discount Car and Truck Rentals and Toshiba Tec Corp., a unit of Toshiba Corp. DarkSide extorted money from the German company Brenntag. The cryptocurrency 
security firm Elliptic stated that a Bitcoin wallet opened by DarkSide in March 2021 had received US$17.5 million from 21 Bitcoin wallets (including the Colonial 
Pipeline ransom), indicating the number of ransoms received over the course of a few months. Elliptic's analysis showed that in total, Darkside received over 
$90 million in ransom payments from at least 47 victims. The average ransom payment was $1.9 million.

3. 2021(May):
The Federal Bureau of Investigation identified DarkSide as the perpetrator of the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, a cyberattack on May 7, 2021, perpetrated by 
malicious code, that led to a voluntary shutdown of the main pipeline supplying 45% of fuel to the East Coast of the United States. The attack was described as the 
worst cyberattack to date on U.S. critical infrastructure. DarkSide successfully extorted about 75 Bitcoin (almost US$5 million) from Colonial Pipeline. 
U.S. officials are investigating whether the attack was purely criminal or took place with the involvement of the Russian government or another state sponsor. 
Following the attack, DarkSide posted a statement claiming that "We are apolitical, we do not participate in geopolitics...Our goal is to make money and not creating
problems for society."

In May 2021, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a joint alert urging the owners and operators of critical infrastructure to take 
certain steps to reduce their vulnerability to DarkSide ransomware and ransomware in general.

On 14 May 2021, in a Russian-language statement obtained by the cybersecurity firms Recorded Future, FireEye, and Intel 471 and reported by the Wall Street Journal 
and The New York Times, DarkSide said that "due to the pressure from the U.S." it was shutting down operations, closing the gang's "affiliate program" (the 
intermediary hackers that DarkSide works with to hack). The specific "pressure" referred to was not clear, but the preceding day, U.S. President Joe Biden 
suggested that the U.S. would take action against DarkSide to "disrupt their ability to operate." DarkSide claimed that it had lost access to its payment server, blog,
and funds withdrawn to an unspecified account. Cybersecurity experts cautioned that DarkSide's claim to have disbanded might be a ruse to deflect scrutiny, and 
possibly allow the gang to resume hacking activities under a different name.[24] It is common for cybercriminal networks to shut down, revive, and rebrand in this way.

Agence France-Presse reporters discovered that the Recorded Future report which detailed the loss of DarkSide servers and funds was retweeted by the Twitter account of
the 780th Military Intelligence Brigade, a US Army Cyberwarfare group involved in offensive operations.

Short timeline of DarkSide activity:

August 2020: DarkSide introduces its ransomware.

October 2020: DarkSide donates US$20,000 stolen from victims to charity.

November 2020: DarkSide establishes its RaaS model. The group invites other criminals to use its service. A DarkSide data leak site is later discovered.

November 2020: DarkSide launches its content delivery network (CDN) for storing and delivering compromised data.

December 2020: A DarkSide actor invites media outlets and data recovery organisations to follow the group’s press centre on the public leak site.

March 2021: DarkSide releases version 2.0 of its ransomware with several updates.

May 2021: DarkSide launches the Colonial Pipeline attack. After the attack, Darkside announces it is apolitical and will start vetting its targets (possibly to avoid 
raising attention to future attacks).

DarkSide attack statistics:
Based on the group’s Tor leak sites, DarkSide determines whether to pursue targeting a potential victim organisation by primarily looking at that organisation’s 
financial records. It also uses this information to determine the amount of ransom to demand, with a typical ransom demand amounting to anywhere between US$200,000 
and US$2 million.

Reports say that, based on the leak sites, there are at least 90 victims affected by DarkSide. In total, more than 2 TB of stolen data is currently being hosted on 
DarkSide sites, and 100% of victims’ stolen files are leaked.

The actors behind Darkside have stated that they avoid targeting companies in certain industries, including healthcare, education, the public sector, and the 
nonprofit sector. Organizations in manufacturing, finance, and critical infrastructure have been identified in Trend Micro data as targets.

Based on Trend Micro data, the US is by far DarkSide’s most targeted country, at more than 500 detections, followed by France, Belgium, and Canada. As previously
mentioned, DarkSide avoids victimising companies in CIS countries. Part of the ransomware execution code checks for the geolocation of potential victims to avoid 
companies in these countries, although the group would likely be aware of the location of a target organisation long before the ransomware is executed. That the group 
admittedly spares companies in CIS countries could be a clue to where DarkSide actors are residing. It is possible that they do this to avoid law enforcement action 
from these countries, since the governments of some of these countries do not persecute criminal acts such as DarkSide’s if they are done on foreign targets.

After the Colonial Pipeline attack, DarkSide released a statement on one of its leak sites clarifying that the group did not wish to create problems for society and 
that its goal was simply to make money. There is no way to verify this statement, but we know that the group is still quite active. As previously mentioned, DarkSide 
actors announced that they had stolen data from three more victims since the Colonial Pipeline attack.

Safety Measures for ransomware attack:
1. Keep strong and unique passwords for login accounts.

2. Turn off the RDP if it is not used. If needed, change the RDP port to a non-standard port.

3. Configure firewall in following way:
 a. Deny access to Public IPs to important ports (in this case RDP port 3389)
 b. Allow access to only IPճ which are under your control.
 
4. Use VPN to access the network, instead of exposing RDP to the Internet. Possibly implement Two Factor Authentication (2FA).

5. Establish a lockout policy that prevents the ability to guess credentials.

6. Create a separate network folder for each user when managing access to shared network folders.

7. Back Up Data Regularly:
  a. Protect systems from ransomware by backing up important files regularly and keep a recent backup copy offline. 
  b. Encrypt your backup.
  c. If your computer gets infected with ransomware, your files can be restored from the offline backup once the malware has been removed.
  d. Always use a combination of online and offline backup.
  
8. Keep Software Updated:
  a. Always keep your security software (antivirus, firewall, etc.) up to date to protect your computer from new variants of malware.
  b. Regularly patch and update applications, software, and operating systems to address any exploitable software vulnerabilities.
  c. Do not download cracked/pirated software as it may contain backdoors.
  d. Avoid downloading software from untrusted P2P or torrent sites, which often host malicious software.
  
9. Having Minimum Required Privileges:Do not provide administrative privileges to users. Do not stay logged in as administrator unless strictly required. In addition,
avoid browsing, opening documents, or other regular work activities while logged in as an administrator.

10. Do not keep offline backups connected to your system as this data could be encrypted during the ransomware attack.

Important terms:
1. Exploiting Public-Facing Applications: Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or 
commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are 
often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart 
Install), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services. Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include Exploitation for Defense Evasion.

2. Privilege Escalation: Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its 
privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation.
The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group 
and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.

3.  Impair Defenses: Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves 
impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious 
behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.
